# OMOCCE

A perma-death tile-bases rpg set on another planet with a rich, multilayered storyline, complex gameplay built with high risk high reward mechanics, an engaging political and economic system all being simulated. The game is not meant to be replayeable, it's a one-time experience.

Goals: 
 ) Simulated story that progresses based on player, ai, political and economical interaction (or lack thereof). This includes seemingly random events (such as death of any NPC under any circumstance)
 ) Simulated political system for several faction. Communication takes place between factions via messengers (bird, man, etc), several behaviours between one faction can havr positive or negqtive effect
 ) Simulated social system similar to the political system but for individuals.
 ) Simulated economic system where trade can occur among all individuals, most notabaly local or travelling merchants, adventurers with loot, or even the common with common goods.
 ) Simulation of all NPCs (or groups iff in a different map than player). Mobs will frequently reproduce and travel, inhabiting various locations. Townsfolk will perform their duties to get resources and try to live a comfortable life
 ) Warfare with several factions fighting each other for political or economic reasons
 ) A combat system designed on momentum, planning ahead, and reading your opponent's next move.
 ) No levelling system. You become proficient the more often you use a skill but lose that proficiency quickly over time. An importancr is played on gear, party members, and losing being a viable option.
 ) A party system that will allow members to manage their own gear, be commanded though unnecessar, and most importantly be a witness to your adventure. All of them have various expectations, emotions, etc and talking to them is more than just plot advancement.
 ) Handcrafted AI with many parts left to simulation, each varies.
 ) A morale system for all to strive to follow. Whether the player abides is optional but it may affect political alignment.
 ) A dialogue system that allows for conversation to be taken between multiple NPCs while anyone nearby can still observe depending on their volume.
 ) Hand made maps (and of course tools to create these)
