# OMOCCE

A perma-death tile-bases rpg set on another planet with a rich, multilayered storyline, complex gameplay built with high risk high reward mechanics, an engaging political and economic system all being simulated. The game is not meant to be replayeable, it's a one-time experience


 Story:
 todo

Goals: 

     ) Simulated story that progresses based on player, ai, political and economical interaction (or lack thereof). This includes seemingly random events (such as death of any NPC under any circumstance)
     ) Simulated political system for several faction. Communication takes place between factions via messengers (bird, man, etc), several behaviours between one faction can havr positive or negqtive effect
     ) Simulated social system similar to the political system but for individuals.
     ) Simulated economic system where trade can occur among all individuals, most notabaly local or travelling merchants, adventurers with loot, or even the common with common goods.
     ) Simulation of all NPCs (or groups iff in a different map than player). Mobs will frequently reproduce and travel, inhabiting various locations. Townsfolk will perform their duties to get resources and try to live a comfortable life
     ) Warfare with several factions fighting each other for political or economic reasons
     ) A combat system designed on momentum, planning ahead, and reading your opponent's next move.
     ) No levelling system. You become proficient the more often you use a skill but lose that proficiency quickly over time. An importancr is played on gear, party members, and losing being a viable option.
     ) A party system that will allow members to manage their own gear, be commanded though unnecessar, and most importantly be a witness to your adventure. All of them have various expectations, emotions, etc and talking to them is more than just plot advancement.
     ) Handcrafted AI with many parts left to simulation, each varies.
     ) A morale system for all to strive to follow. Whether the player abides is optional but it may affect political alignment.
     ) A dialogue system that allows for conversation to be taken between multiple NPCs while anyone nearby can still observe depending on their volume.
    ) Hand made maps (and of course tools to create these)

Example of thr complexity of the game:
 A travelling group of Eykin pass nearby a towne and hole up near a cave. A villager is travelling to this towne to sell some excess wheat he farmed. He spots the Eykin tracks (they are large and distinct compared to other mobs, but the trCks are too old to know how many are in the group) and decides they are close enough to warrant warning the towne guards. The towne guard sends a scout to report information and is killed along the way. After two days without the scout's return, the towne sends a large group to handle this. The tracks at this point have whithered which makes it hard to navigate, and by the time they arrive the cave had been abandoned. Reporting a failed expedition eith a casualty of one, the mayor of the Towne blames this on a man high in command of the guards and might try to get him deranked. Meanwhile, you are on the other side of the globe. or, maybe, you planted the tracks there, killed the scout and hid his body for malicious reasons.
