# OMOCCE

A perma-death text rpg set on another planet with a rich, multilayered storyline, complex gameplay built with high risk high reward mechanics, an engaging political and economic system all being simulated. The game is not meant to be replayeable, it's a one-time experience.

Goals: 
 ) Simulated story that progresses based on player, ai, political and economical interaction (or lack thereof). This includes seemingly random events (such as death of any NPC under any circumstance)
 ) Simulated political system for several faction. Communication takes place between factions via messengers (bird, man, etc), several behaviours between one faction can havr positive or negqtive effects.
 ) Simulated economic system where trade can occur among all individuals, most notabaly local or travelling merchants, adventurers with loot, or even the common with common goods.
 ) Simulation of all NPCs (or groups iff in a different map than player). Mobs will frequently reproduce and travel, inhabiting various locations. Townsfolk will perform their duties to get resources and try to live a comfortable life





 ) Hand made maps (and of course tools to create these)
