# OMOCCE

A perma-death text rpg set on another planet with a rich, multilayered storyline, complex gameplay built with high risk high reward mechanics, an engaging political and economic system all being simulated. The game is not meant to be replayeable, it's meant to be a one-time experience.

Goals:
 ) Hand made maps (and of course tools to create these)
